## What is Bcash?

`Bcash` is peer-to-peer electronic cash for the Internet. It is fully decentralized, with no central bank and requires no trusted third parties to operate.

### Where can I discuss Bcash?

There is a subreddit at [r/bcash](https://reddit.com/r/bcash)

### What is Bcash's ticker symbol?

BCH

### Is Bcash different from 'Bitcoin'?

Yes. `Bcash` is the continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer digital cash. It is a fork of the Bitcoin blockchain ledger, with upgraded consensus rules that allow it to grow and scale.

### Where is the code?

You can view the source code [here](https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc)

### If I own Bitcoin, do I automatically own Bcash too? 

Yes. Because `Bcash` is a fork of the ledger, that means you own the same amount of bcash as you did Bitcoin at the time of the forking block. However, if your Bitcoins are stored by a third party such as an exchange, then you must inquire with them about your bcash.

If you want to convert your BCash to Bitcoin, [follow these instructions](http://www.maor.io/sell-bcash/).

### Why was a fork needed to create Bcash?

The legacy Bitcoin code had a maximum limit of 1MB of data per block, or about 3 transactions per second. Although technically simple to raise this limit, the community could not reach a consensus, even after years of debate.

### Which development team is in charge of Bcash? 

There is no one single development team for Bcash. There are now multiple independent teams of developers. This decentralization of development (and decentralization of software implementations) is a much needed and important step forward.
